# XSELLCO-API Python Wrapper

This project provides a Python wrapper for interacting with the [repricer.com](https://www.repricer.com/) (aka xsellco) API, allowing developers to easily integrate the API's functionality into their Python applications.


## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Installing
pypi.org not yet setup, for now you can install directly from github by:

    pip install xsellco_api

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo
